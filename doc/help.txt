When running `rake db:create` (or migrating from sqlite3 to postgresql) you probably will get the error "FATAL:  role "User" does not exist ".
To fix this, read it:

```
Add a username to your database.yml, might as well use your application's name (or some variant of the name) as the username. I'' use app_name as a placeholder: config/database.yml => username: app_name

$ sudo -u postgres psql
postgres=# create role app_name login createdb;
postgres=# \q
run `rake db:create`
```
